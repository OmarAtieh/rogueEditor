Notes on a few high-impact quirks (so you can plan engine hooks)

Freeze-Dry: Ice move that’s always 2× vs Water, even if its own type would say otherwise. Great as an override_multiplier rule.

Flying Press: calculate effectiveness as Fighting × Flying simultaneously—treat as a special combined chart.

Electrify / Ion Deluge / Plasma Fists: convert move types to Electric (target’s next move, or all Normal moves this turn). Handle before chart lookup.

Grounding: Thousand Arrows / Smack Down / Gravity strip Ground immunities; Thousand Arrows also hits ungrounded targets and is neutral on Flying on first contact.
